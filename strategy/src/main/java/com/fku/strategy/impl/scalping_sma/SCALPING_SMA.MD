### Golden Cross (TODO)
Pattern formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average (such as the 15-day moving average) 
breaking above its long-term moving average (such as 50-day moving average).
As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced
by high trading volumes.
