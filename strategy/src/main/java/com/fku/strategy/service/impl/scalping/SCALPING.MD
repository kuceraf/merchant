# Scalping Strategy
## Definition
Forex scalping is a trading strategy used by forex traders to buy or sell a currency pair and then hold it for a short 
period of time in an attempt to make a profit. A forex scalper looks to make a large number of trades and earn a small 
profit each time.

Forex scalping can be most lucrative around periods of high volatility and significant market moves.

Forex system trading could be based on a set of signals derived from technical analysis or fundamental news-based events.
